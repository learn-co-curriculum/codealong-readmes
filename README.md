A codealong Readme is a great way to explicity walk your student through solving a problem and having them build, fix, and work on the code needed to do so. 

As with all Readmes, you should be presenting the conflict and using real-world scenarios. But in solving the problem, you will not just show and explain the code but will also have your student code along with you. 

This can be done in a couple of ways. You can have your students create the specific files needed and copy and manipulate the code you provide. 

The better way is to have these files created already with the necessary starter code already in those files. Instruct your students to simply fork and clone the repository and follow along with you. 

While codealongs don't need to be test driven, adding tests would be a plus so that both we and the students know that they're following along correctly.
